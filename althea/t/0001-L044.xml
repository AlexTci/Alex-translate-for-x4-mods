	   <t id="10005">This Ship is an addition to Easy Life, it is more or less cheating. It holds tons of people for the missions, is a very good fighter, almost undestructable, kills even Ks without much of a sweat and has the looks of a absolutely beautiful ship in the game, the Kobra. Lean back and enjoy your Easy Life in X4.</t>
