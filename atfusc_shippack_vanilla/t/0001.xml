			<t id="3">The Tyr-class destroyer of the AGI Task Force was once the mobile heavy weapons platform of the Earth Fleet, capable of leveling entire Xenon stations and capital ships with its versatile array of weaponry. Decommissioned along with most ships of the USC and ATF, its role was taken over by its successors - the Syn-class destroyer and the Asgard-class battleship.\n\nAmidst the Jump Gate shutdown and the founding of the Terran Protectorate, a contingent of veteran military shipwrights took an offer from a private contractor to update several USC and ATF designs to modern standards under an experiment authorized by a branch of the Terran government. Due to the secretive nature of their assignment, they were unable to receive the original schematics of the ships under the threat of discovery and instead, depended on creating their own from decommisioned models.\n\nOne of the first to receive modifications from its original variant, the augmented Tyr saw a substantial increase in its scale effectively turning it into a battleship-class vessel whilst retaining its all-rounded combat effectiveness of an M2. Prototype testing is still currently undergoing however, although allies of the inner circle of the Protectorate have authorization to purchase a blueprint of the ship for a steep price.</t>

			<t id="3">One of the biggest ships in the known universe, the Valhalla-class superheavy destroyer doubled as the AGI Task Force's flagship and command center. Easily dwarfing every other battleship of the Commonwealth and even the Xenon of its time, its presence alone was greatly feared by the enemies of Earth, not to mention its various capabilities. Being too large to be able to enter jump gates, it relied on warp technology to traverse through the universe. It was once said that the Valhalla knows everything that moves in Terran space, but that was refuted when the Torus Incident occurred. The destruction of the Torus, the Jump Gate shutdown, and the dissolution of both the USC and ATF would ultimately see the massive platform retired under the new Protectorate service.\n\nDuring the early years of the Gate shutdown, several Terran admirals contested the decommissioning of the ship, seeing it too valuable and strategic to simply put it out of the picture. One side argued that existing ships could be relegated into Brennan's Triumph delta as a defensive chokepoint between the Terrans and the Commonwealth in case of another attack, while the other argued that it serves as a large drain on the Terrans' resources and that its duty is best suited for the Asgard-class battleship. While debates on whether the ship should be put back into service were happening, veteran ATF shipwrights, with the support of ATF hardliners, covertly worked on overhauling the aging Valhalla to modern standards to sway the opinion of the Protectorate figureheads, upgrading it with massive shield and weapon generators that would allow the ship to serve as a mobile stronghold. When rumors broke out about the updated Valhalla years later, the Protectorate had already cleared the blueprint but had not yet decided whether it should be redeployed.\n\nThe ship is so massive that the Terrans have devised its own unique "XXL-sized" multipurpose bay, the only structure where the Valhalla can safely dock and perform repairs and upgrades. Such power comes with great responsibility and cost, and as such, only the closest allies of Earth are welcome to try and construct one of their own if they are willing to make a significant "donation" to the Terran cause.</t>

			<t id="3">As both the United Space Command and the AGI Task Force operated independently from each other, one branch had to be subjected to certain restrictions in the event that one of their assets would be temporarily requisitioned by the other. In this regard, the USC primarily lacked a large and powerful destroyer in comparison to the ATF's Valhalla-class superheavy destroyer. While the ATF had the advantage of deploying stronger combat-oriented vessels than the USC, the USC has always had the upper hand as the main supplier of trading and mining vessels among the Terran populace. Nonetheless, this did not stop the USC from conceptualizing a superheavy destroyer to bring them on par with the ATF, especially during a time when they have failed their mandate to defend the Torus Aeternal from outside attacks.\n\nDeployed by the United Space Command at the apex of the Terran Conflict, the Kyoto-class superheavy destroyer was the United Space Command's premier capital ship, a counterpart to their sister service's M2+. Bolstering a sheer-and-sleek design, the Kyoto maintains a small broadside profile, allowing its turrets' line of fire to be larger than most ships of its class while also being harder to hit. Over the years following the gate shutdown, the design was then improved upon during their isolation. Outfitted with strongly-shielded classified engine housing technology as well as several changes to its docking and storage capabilities, the Kyoto was redesigned to be a rapid-response battlecarrier allowing it to achieve incredible speeds for its size as well as deploy entire fighter squadrons using its various newly-installed launchtubes at a moment's notice without sacrificing an inch of its anti-capital ship capabilities.\n\nThere are rumors that the ship was never decommissioned - that it is merely being redesigned and tested constantly in some unknown part of the Sol system, although the Protectorate has no comment on the matter. The blueprints of an older version, however, are available to the closest allies of Earth, under close watch by High Command.</t>

			<t id="3">Once the standard heavy frigate of the AGI Task Force, the Aegir played an essential role in the Terran's counter-AGI effort and later on, the conflict against the Community of Planets. Due to advancements with the M7C frigates, the Aegir was eventually decommissioned after the development of the Falx-class frigate, carrying the features of both the M7 and M7C.\n\nA certain Terran PMC specializing in deep-space operations sought a ship design that would bridge the gap between frigate and destroyer and the Aegir's design fit the specifications perfectly. Upgraded for the current era, it features heavier weaponry and more powerful internal systems allowing it to take on a wide range of targets - from heavy fighters to light destroyers. Although originally unsanctioned by the Protectorate, several agreements took place and the ship was considered eligible for sale to pilots with sufficient privileges on their shipyards.</t>

			<t id="3">A legendary ship once known for singlehandedly deciding the outcome of a battle through sheer missile barrages, the Skirnir-class missile frigate of the AGI Task Force was a highly controversial ship among the Community of Planets as it could destroy entire sectors with the Terran-made Shadow and Ghoul Missiles of the time, which some captains of the USC and ATF had no problem using against the Argon primarily at the height of the Terran Conflict.\n\nWhen the gates re-opened, the need for such a heavy missile warship was not seen due to the relatively peaceful setting. Despite this, the Terrans, having endured the AGI attack and the destruction of the Torus Aeternal by the Argons, have devised a comprehensive contingency plan. For this purpose, the Skirnir, long decommissioned, was used as a platform and received an overhaul, effectively turning it into a heavy missile destroyer. Along with upgrades to its aging missile barrage system, the Skirnir was retrofitted with the latest components designed to balance out its role as a missile destroyer, dedicated to engaging capital ships and stations at a range with the new Laevateinn Multi-Missiles.</t>

			<t id="7">Laevateinn Multi-Missile</t>
			<t id="8">After a dangerous flaw in the Shadow Missile's design was discovered and fixed during the Terran Conflict, newer batches supplied to the Terran military were far weaker than the ones used in the cold war as a result in exchange for reliability. This led several Terran engineers and physicists being hired by the joint USC-ATF research team on Saturn to work on an advanced cluster missile that would succeed both the Shadow Missile and the Ghoul Missile all in one package. Developed very late into the war against the Argon Federation, the Laevateinn Multi-Missile was the product of extensive research on point-singularity technology and other classified weapons technology held closely secret by the best Terran weaponsmiths.\n\nThe warheads however saw very little use due to the following jump gate shutdown event which would happen a few days after it was cleared for use, although it had an incredibly high destruction rate in the few operations that it was used on. The Terran government took a gamble and produced several more of the warheads in hopes of being ready for the next conflict, but the dissolution of the United Space Command and the AGI Task Force will precede such a time and the massive stockpile was relegated to safekeeping by the newly-founded Protectorate. It was not until 2973 that it would see action once again with the updated Skirnir-class missile destroyers, designed to inflict even bigger destruction than its predecessors.</t>

			<t id="3">Ancient by today's standards, the Vidar-class corvette of the AGI Task Force was long superseded by the Vali and eventually the Protectorate-issued Katana. What it lacks on modern ship technology, it makes up with its very high manoeuvrability.\n\nAlthough the design itself is very old, a few Terran engineers have found a way to overhaul the ship to an extent, bringing it almost on par with the newest-generation corvettes. The internal systems are still dated, but upgrades to its engine systems allow it to stand out from the rest of the M-class ships.</t>

			<t id="3">The first ship to make contact with the Commonwealth after the Earth gate was activated and also the one to save their fleet from the Kha'ak at Heretic's End, the Odin-class battlecruiser had long been a staple of the Earth Fleet and the AGI Task Force. By the events of the Terran Conflict, its capabilities were considered to be highly advanced, being able to stand against destroyers and battleships better compared to other ships of its class. Due to its combat prowess in dealing with hostile Commonwealth capitals combined with its force projection capabilities, the Odin became the mainstay mobile combat coordination vessel of not just the Earth Fleet, but also for most of the Terran military.\n\nDuring the events of the Jump Gate shutdown, the ship was initially spared from decommissioning unlike most of the ATF ships although the newly-founded Terran Protectorate saw little use for such a heavy carrier, and as such, the Protectorate-issued Mark III Tokyo became the mainstay carrier of their fleets. Several decades of peace would see the former ATF M1 carrier rust away, but fate had another plan for the ship as the gates once again re-opened in 2973. The Odin was then modified to emphasize its heavy carrier role, sacrificing its fighter bays for corvette-sized bays.\n\nUnlike most of the updated pre-shutdown-era ATF ships, it is currently one of two ships directly sold by Terran shipyards. The Protectorate eventually concluded that its own Tokyo-class carriers could work in tandem with the Odin-class and Woden-class heavy carriers and allowed the sale of it to eligible allies of Earth.</t>

			<t id="3">Based from the chassis of the last-generation Tokyo, the Mobile Mining Base-Ship was the designated deep-space support miner of the Terrans. It served as a base ship for other mining vessels, which would stock minerals into the ship to increase the total payload per run. When the gates shut down, demand for minerals dwindled due to the war economy stagnating, which would see the ship phased out.\n\nWhen the gates re-opened in 2973, it was put back into service with notable changes to its design, a few of which include the capital-grade turrets being replaced with modern L-sized mining turrets and having its docks reduced for greater storage and gas mining capabilities to support the ever-growing Protectorate's interventionist campaign against the Xenon.</t>

			<t id="3">Designated as a possible replacement for the Odin, the Woden-class battlecarrier was designed to fulfill a flexible role as part-destroyer and part-carrier, causing Terran officials to question its capabilities as a dual-purpose capital ship when compared against ships with dedicated roles. This ship was subject to heavy debate as to whether it could be a worthy successor to the tried-and-tested Odin but consensus would ultimately see it approved as a replacement further down the line. Since the Terran Conflict was the only opportunity for the ATF to make use of the Odin's force projection capability, issues arose from the Odin's launchers being placed near its massive engine blocks, leading to some launched fighters being hit by the ship's engine if the carrier was moving at high speeds. The Woden would later on designed to have upwards-facing launchbays which would alleviate the problem, at the cost of smaller fighter holding capacity. Before the decision could be enacted however, the gates started to malfunction and the Terrans would eventually move back all their assets back into the Sol system, delaying the decision even further.\n\nAs the Terran Conflict waned, the demand for such a heavy carrier was eventually not seen. The newly-founded Terran Protectorate had initially supported an overhaul of the Woden, but found it too costly compared to the USC's Mark II Tokyo-class carrier. As a result, the next-generation Tokyo would eventually take over both the Woden and Odin on their carrier roles. This decision though would not hold long after 2973 when the gates have re-opened as part of a new contingency plan. Unlike the Odin, which was revamped into a slightly different role with their redesigns, the Woden kept its purpose intact as an S-ship battlecarrier that could be relegated to battleship duty when the need arises. Boasting several large turrets and a spacious landing area, the Woden is a formidable force-multiplier when running either solo or with a fleet.</t>

			<t id="3">A one-of-a-kind ship built in 2936 by a classified shipwright for a renowned fighter ace, the Verdandi super-interceptor was an oversized high-speed Terran fighter capable of performing deep-space reconnaissance of enemy territory and intercepting priority targets in the blink of an eye. Harking back to age-old Terran designs of the 21st and 22nd centuries mixed with older ATF design philosophies, it bolsters a forward-swept wing configuration giving it incredible speeds in atmospheric flight at the cost of maneuverability at such high speeds. Zero-G flight fires up all rear engines and thrusters to provide the maximum mobility possible to give the pilot the edge they need in every combat scenario. The ship would, later on, be lost with the Torus Aeternal's destruction by Argon sabotage in 2948, striking a significant blow to the Terrans' recon capabilities on their enemies far from the Solar System.\n\nIn the final moments of the Terran Conflict, the ship's wreckage seemingly disappeared during the initial cleanup operations. A few months later, there were sightings of the ship flying back and forth the Terran border. It was found to have been redesigned with a heavier frame on par with a small corvette seemingly to increase its survivability dramatically. It would later prove instrumental in ensuring the continuity of the ceasefire talks deep in Commonwealth territory with the pilot thwarting the Yaki Syndicate's attempt to destroy the Goner Ozias and saving both Terran and Argon ambassadors. The fate of the original ship after the Jump Gate shutdown remains unknown although the blueprint of a replica is said to be available to Sol's most trusted military officers who are also in good standing with the Terran Secret Service.</t>

			<t id="3">The sole segment left intact after the emergency separation sequence was initiated, the 87th segment of the Torus Aeternal was one of several auxiliary ship-building segments operating under the Earth Fleet, with a focus on refitting USC ships for long-distance operations. Due to an on-site accident involving a notorious stunt pilot and their Springblossom-class corvette, the segment was temporarily separated from the superstructure to avoid collateral damage while extensive maintenance work was undergoing on its ship fabrication modules. When Saya Kho and Sherman Hiatu initiated the emergency segment separation process from segment #05, segment #87 remained separated from the rest of the ring sparing it the irreversible damage that all the other segments had undergone. After the post-separation assessments were completed, the 87th segment was deemed fully functional with its shipyard functionalities left intact. The United Space Command, under heavy scrutiny from GEOSS for the loss of the superstation, rapidly scrambled to move the segment away from the debris of the segment connectors in hopes of saving the Torus' shipyard capability.\n\nSince the destruction of the Torus Aeternal was known to be total, the USC decided to tow the structure away deep into a more secretive part of Earth space only known to a very few trusted personnel. From there, they continued repairs at a slow pace, mostly due to the lack of engineers, up until the Terran Protectorate would later on support it with more personnel to ultimately finish it. Repairs to Segment #87 would be finished in 2988, but it was decided to keep its existence a secret for citizens outside of the Inner Core, even to military personnel.\n\nAs of 2995, it currently serves as a private museum dedicated to the ATF, the USC, and the Torus Aeternal for Inner Core license holders as well as serving as the headquarters of the group of Terran shipwrights and engineers under a certain experimental division.</t>
