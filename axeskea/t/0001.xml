			<t id="13324">The Kea combines respectable speed, shielding and armament to create a well-rounded starship capable of tackling any challenge. In classic fashion Teladi shipwrights managed to squeeze an oversized cargo bay into this vessels small frame, compensating for this extra weight with far more engines than is usually necessary for a ship of this size. The sluggish agility resulting from all this extra equipment has lead many crews to refer to this new addition to the Teladi lineup as (loosely translated) "The Brick".</t>
