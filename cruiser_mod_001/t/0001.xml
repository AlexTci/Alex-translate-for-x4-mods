As the Terran Conflict unraveled, a sudden expansion of Terran space became a distinct possibility. To prepare for this eventuality, the United Space Command began work on designing ships capable of policing newly conquered systems, serving as protection from pirates and hostile skirmishing fleets alike. They would have to be fast enough to chase down any enemy invader and durable enough to engage them on their own until stronger reinforcements arrive. However, before the first hulls were completed the gate shutdown forced USC to direct its resources elsewhere. Now that the gate network realigned and a threat of a new conflict is looming, the old designs were updated and scheduled for production. The Miyagi is the lightest of the terran cruisers. It is fast and well shielded. Intended mostly for rapid response to pirate and Khaak raids, it can stand up to lightly armed destroyers but is no match for Xenon capital ships. It sports an expanded S ships storage and a large crew component. Together with its speed this ship is well suited for retaking larger trade vessels that had been boarded and taken over by pirates.</t>

However, before the first hulls were completed the gate shutdown forced USC to direct its resources elsewhere. Now that the gate network realigned and a threat of a new conflict is looming, the old designs were updated and scheduled for production. The Yamagata is the most common of the terran cruisers. It is well shielded and has an impressive array of large turrets. It was designed to hunt down lone enemy destroyers and their smaller escorts. Yamagata has a large crew component that comes in handy during boarding operations. If the conditions are right this expensive ship can even stand up to a Xenon K.</t>

			<t id="3"> The Okayama is a L carrier based on old USC designs that never had a chance to go into production before the gate shutdown. As other cruiser models were meant to counter pirate raiders and lone enemy destroyers, this mighty warship was made to handle more serious threats. While the lighter Miyagi and Yamagata were to patrol internal sectors, the Okayama was meant to defend the most dangerous border sectors and strategically important areas and stations of the then unravelling Terran Conflict. As the gate shutdown began, the USC had to divert its resources elsewhere and no heavy cruiser of this type was ever built. Now however, with the gate network realignment, the Terran Protectorate finds itself with a need for a heavy warship. The Okayama is heavily armed and very well shielded. It has a large crew capacity and a decent fighter docking pad. That power comes at a price however, as the heavy cruiser is both very expensive and relatively slow. This ship can easily stop a Xenon K, and with little luck, even a whole Xenon raid.</t>

			<t id="3">  The Kagawa is a XL battlecruiser based on old designs from the Terran-Conflict era. After the recent gate network realignment skirmishes with the Xenon forces revealed the much feared weaknesses of the Asgard. Its lack of mobility often prevents it from bringing its powerful forward artillery to bear on a moving target, rendering the ship nearly useless in actual combat. As more engagements happened, it became increasingly obvious that normally weaker mobile force would be at an advantage against the main Terran Fleet. This has raised concerns among the terran admiralty that requested a more flexible warship to be added to the Terran Protectorate's Fleet. In response, an old USC design was updated and made ready for production. The Kagawa is a mighty warship that pushes the engineering boundaries of what is possible with XL-class ship power cores. This battlecruiser has an impressive array of heavy turrets and can have up to six L-class shield generators. Its hull is very durable and it has a large crew capacity. The Kagawa is however very slow and extremely expensive, with a price tag and an operating speed comparable to that of Asgard's. This has led many Terran captains to refer to it as a 'pocket battleship'. At the same time its many turrets can effectively counter any fleet formations that focus on speed rather than raw power. The Kagawa makes for an excellent flagship or a lead vessel of a larger fleet.</t>

			<t id="3">  The Nagano is a medium cruiser built by the Segaris Pioneers. Realizing that the Terran Protectorate will always prioritise defense of Earth, even at the cost of its distant colonies, people of the Segaris faction decided to build up their own private military forces. However the Earth’s Government refused them access to schematics for powerful ships like Tokyo or the Asgard. Fearing a possible conflict would require a diversified space fleet, the Pioneers set to work on designing their own ships. Lacking the practical experience in the military field that other races had, it was decided that the needed technology would be procured through a mix of bribery and espionage. The resulting ship designs are a balanced mix of Terran, Argon and Split design philosophies. The Nagano is the backbone of Segaris Pioneer space navy. It has good shielding, powerful prow gun and a decent array of anti-fighter weapons. It can stand its ground against both destroyers and cruisers. It’s main strength is the ability to focus all its firepower at enemies directly in front of the ship. This is especially handy during sieging stations or blockading jumpgates. Thanks to its large array of M-turrets it doesn’t have to rely on fighter support like most ships of this class have to. </t>

The Akita is designed to provide anti-fighter and anti-corvette protection as well as missile defense support to the Segaris fleets. It has extensive M-turret arrays that will make short work of any hostile bomber groups. At the same time it does not have enough firepower to challenge most other L ships. This makes the Akita ideal to undertake mining fleet escort duties and a capable lead ship of independent system patrol task forces aimed at countering skirmishing Xenon and Khaak fighter groups. In large fleet operations it serves mainly as a good picket ship for larger vessels like Nagano or Tokushima. Thanks to its prow main gun it can also participate in station sieges effectively.  </t>

			<t id="3">  The Ashikaga is a command cruiser built by the Segaris Pioneers. After the Terran Protectorate refused to share its Tokyo blueprints with the newly founded Segaris private military fleet, the colonists decided to design their own carrier. Unable to steal the Protectorate’s schematics, Segaris researchers began to procure the needed practical engineering solutions by similar means from other races. Targeting the most disorganized and easily corrupt, Split and Teladi technology soon found its way into the Segaris scientists’ hands. By adding a fair amount of terran technological prowess and ingenuity the Pioneers were soon able to design a reasonable compromise between a fleet carrier and a heavy cruiser. The resulting ship was a well balanced ship with no outstanding weaknesses or strengths, that can be used as a centerpiece of a larger fleet. The Ashikaga fills the role of a carrier and mobile headquarters of the Segaris Pioneer fleets. While it lacks the capacity of larger dedicated carriers like the Tokyo, it can still house and coordinate a decent number of fighter wings. Compared to dedicated carriers however, the Ashikaga is much better armed and can actively participate in fleet combat while at the same time providing fighter support during the battle. If that wasn’t enough, this command ship can operate and maintain an impressive amount of fighter drones. Sadly all those features come at a cost. To house all of the additional equipment much of the missile and cargo storage had to be sacrificed. The ship’s speed is also heavily reduced. This makes Ashikaga unable to take much supplies with it into hostile territory, forcing it to rely on small trade vessels to keep it supplied. </t>

			<t id="3">  The Terran Yokohama is a powerful destroyer and a more missile-focused alternative to the Osaka. It is based on a tried-and-true design from the times of the Terran Conflict. It has a pair of powerful forward artillery mounts and a good array of turrets spread around the hull. This ship can perform both anti-capital role, as well as anti-small craft patrol duties. The ship was developed from an older design in an attempt to offer more flexibility to the Protectorate's fleets. Even in the early tests, the Yokohama proved to be a match for the Osaka destroyers and even outperformed it in certain situations. Even though it was somewhat more expensive to build, the Earth's Admiralty made a decision to introduce it into service. Yokohama is best used in groups of two or three vessels, where its good shielding and impressive weaponry can be employed to the best effect. When supporting other ships it should be paired with other units that have forward guns of similar range. Yokohama is durable, but it can't withstand serious bombardment from heavily armed capital ships like the Xenon K or the Split Rattlesnake. For this reason it is better to use it as a part of a bigger task force or sent in only after more durable ships moved in. Thanks to its large missile capacity, the ship can be tailored for a variety of roles. Against stations, Yokohama is best left to bombard the installations from range with its powerful forward batteries.</t>

			<t id="3">  The Scabbard is a dedicated troop transport and a picket escort ship. Its main purpose is providing Terran fleets with increased boarding capacity. The vessel can also be employed as a light patrol ship for more remote areas of space. It is cheap enough to be fielded in large numbers and can at the same time provide enough firepower to be useful. The ship is a result of a joint military research initiative between the Segaris Pioneers and the Terran Protectorate. With the heavier units of the Earth's fleet needed at the frontlines, there was a need for the Pioneers to provide their own security for trade fleets and vital mining regions. Since the initial design proved to be an effective anti-fighter vessel that could be produced in large numbers the joint leadership of both factions decided to press it into service. This decision coincided with a time of increased pirate activity which made Scabbard even more necessary for the Terrans. With its large crew quarters and sufficient armaments it gave the Terran Admirals the ability to recapture vessels boarded by pirates. The Scabbard is a light vessel not capable of fighting better armed and shielded destroyers on its own. It is better left as an escort for important trade convoys and vulnerable mining ships. In fleet combat the Scabbard performs best in large groups either in a fire support role or performing boarding operations when the hostile fleet is distracted. When using this ship to attack well armed targets it is best to send it in the second or even third wave, when most of the enemy firepower will be already engaged with other targets.</t>

Together with its three engines, the ship can move large amounts of cargo quickly, especially over longer distances where it outperforms the Okinawa. The ship was developed as a part of the Terran Joint Logistics Improvement initiative. After the gate realignment both Terran factions noticed the solutions employed by other races allowed their seemingly inferior economy to outperform the one of Sol. This was initially attributed solely to the Teladi mercantile proficiency giving them an unfair advantage. After an in-depth study, the Terrans realized it was mostly due to better designs used by the other faction’s merchant fleets. Soon after, the decision was made to prove the might of the Terran ingenuity not only on the battlefield but also on the markets. One of the ships born from this development program was the Aomori medium freighter. The Aomori is a fast vessel with the right mix of strengths to make it a competitive ship in the known gate network. It is ideal to carry out regular trades in friendly and safe sectors where it can outrun most of the competition. It has enough shields and armaments to hold off enemy raiding parties long enough for reinforcements to arrive. If a larger force will catch up to it it will certainly be lost without serious escort.</t>

			<t id="3">  Fukuoka is an armed freighter developed by the Terran Protectorate. It is a cargo vessel with armaments almost equalling a destroyer. The main role of this ship is to transport precious cargo through the most dangerous sectors or as a support ship, carrying valuable supplies for the fleet into combat zones. The ship has an expanded missile storage enabling it to carry ammunition for other vessels and resupply them on the frontlines when proper supply ships are not available. During engagements the Fukuoka can reliably support the fleet rather than being a liability like the conventional freighters. The ship was developed by the Terran Protectorate on the order of the Earth High Command that wanted to provide its intervention fleets with more logistic capability. With some factions outright refusing to support the Terrans fighting the Xenon on their borders, a secure way of transporting vital supplies safely from Sol is crucial. Fukuoka was designed to reliably repel boarders and enemy raids as well as endure in a fleet combat engagement. Even during early testing the ship proved to outperform the initial expectations and the decision to introduce it permanently into the Terran Protectorate fleet was made. The Fukuoka is a versatile ship that can be used in many roles. It can serve as a competent cargo transporter but also as a combat vessel. This versatility comes at a steep price however and a serious reduction to the ship speed. The foremost use of this vessel is in large convoys, protecting valuable wares from pirates and hostile factions alike. If not used for transporting cargo through dangerous sectors, the ship excels as an escort vessel for carriers and supply ships. It can carry extra missiles as well as ship building components, both in abundance. In prolonged operations it can add to cargo capacity of a carrier group greatly without the need to pull back from the hostile sector or rely on vulnerable smaller trade ships. At the same time it can use its endurance and firepower to help fend off destroyer or smallcraft attacks on the carrier groups. In extreme cases it can be equipped with missile turrets providing a formidable strike capability in a difficult situation.</t>

			<t id="3">  Kumamoto is a strike destroyer developed by the Terran Protectorate. Unlike most destroyers it does not rely on heavy forward artillery to take down targets. Instead, it can be equipped with an impressive array of missile and torpedo launchers that can devastate a target in one salvo. Some of its forward weaponry can be replaced by various weapons normally used by much smaller frigates. This makes the Kumamoto a very versatile ship that can provide the fleet with many specialized capabilities. The initial design was proposed to the Terran High Command shortly after the gate network realignment. At the time it was rejected, as it was believed that any threat too great for the Osaka destroyer could be matched by the mighty Asgard battleship. After observing how other factions dealt with Xenon, the Terrans came to a conclusion that much of the alien successes were due to heavy employment of missiles. With that in mind the design previously deemed too expensive was reconsidered. The final result of the ensuing development program was the Kumamoto strike destroyer. While expensive to maintain, the Kumamoto is able to deliver devastating strikes to enemy fleets. It can be outfitted for any task, be it anti-capital ship torpedo attacks or screening a fleet from enemy fighters with hundreds of interceptor missiles. If used properly it can devastate enemy stations in mere minutes. It is considerably less durable than other destroyers, which makes it more efficient when used as part of the second wave of attacks. When most enemy heavy weapons are preoccupied with other targets, the Kumamoto can use the moment to deliver a decisive blow to the key enemy targets. Similar tactic should be used when attacking stations, as this vessel needs to get in closer to the target than most destroyers. In the hands of a skilled captain, the Kumamoto can be a truly deadly weapon, employing a vast array of weapons in different combinations to maximize its tactical advantage.</t>

			<t id="3">  Shizuoka is a heavy freighter employed by the Segaris Pioneers. Its main advantage is an expanded cargo bay that greatly outshines what the more common Okinawa offers. With a reasonable speed and defenses for its size, the Shizuoka allows the Terran captains to compete with other races of the gate network in the great economic race.  The ship was developed as a part of the Terran Joint Logistics Improvement initiative. After the gate realignment both Terran factions noticed the solutions employed by other races allowed their seemingly inferior economy to outperform the one of Sol. This was initially attributed solely to the Teladi mercantile proficiency giving them an unfair advantage.

Soon after, the decision was made to prove the might of the Terran ingenuity not only on the battlefield but also on the markets. One of the ships born from this development program was the Shizuoka heavy freighter. This vessel is a great cargo ship that is best used for in-system trades between stations. Its vast cargo space allows it to carry impressive amounts of wares, especially the small volume ones that need to be transported in large quantities and often. Shizuoka lacks both the defense and speed to resist stronger pirate raids or enemy attacks, it should therefore be provided with escorts or operated within friendly sectors. The large total value of wares it will be transporting make it a particularly valuable target for outlaws and providing this ship with escorts is a must. For any Terran captain who has no access to the merchant ships of other factions, Shizuoka heavy freighter is a worthwhile purchase and a good candidate for a backbone of any large scale logistic system.</t>
