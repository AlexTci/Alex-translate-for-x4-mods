		 <t id="5">This ship, the Aikoku Maru, was conceived by the Split as one more mining ship to operate in their sectors. However, due to the compromised geopolitical situation that the families were going through, it was transformed into a mixed passenger and cargo ship (274 crew), as well as an auxiliary cruise ship, with the dual objective of operating as a privateer and as a supply ship for the Fleet Combined in far quadrants. Thus it was captured and manufactured as a class of its own by the Paranid. It has also been later adopted by pirate factions.</t>
