		<t id="4">The Boann is a ship, which was initially designed by TerraCorp and is now in service by the Argons.\n\nThis massive mining vessel is a huge invest as it is one of the single most expensive civilian ships that can be obtained. But this ship is worth it´s money as it provides a huge storage and an increased drone capacity to fill it´s cargo bay.\n\nAs if that wasn´t already enough, the ship also provides superior protection by having cruiser level shielding and an impressive amount of point defense turrets to protect it´s valuable cargo.\n\nAll those features make the Boann the perfect choice for deepspace or high risk mining operations.</t>
