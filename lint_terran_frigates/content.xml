Although lackluster when facing L-sized ships, it excels at providing anti-fighter coverage.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[b] Kitsune: [/b]&#13;&#10;Akita classes refitted by Segrais Pioneers. Although virtually identical to the Akita-class, the refit is designed to be able to hold off capital ships aloneâ€”at least while its ammunition lasts. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[img]https://imgur.com/bWUHLgv.jpg[/img]" author="Lint5" version="250" date="2023-12-28" lastupdate="1669846170">
