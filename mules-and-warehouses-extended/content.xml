It is the one you will use to sell from your warehouses and other stations to every other faction.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[*][b]Station Mule[/b]&#13;&#10;These mules were the first in the family and are great for dedicated supply lines between two stations, back and forth, also are the ONLY ones who can create Warehouse Stations for centralised storage and distribution centres.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[*][b]Supply Mule[/b]&#13;&#10;This Mule acts as a dedicated fetch mule for all own stations ware needs (or when assigned to a particular single station), for times when you just want to supply stations and nothing more. It does a job the Station Mule is capable to do only this is the only purpose. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;He will try to serve your builder first to get the station up and running, buys from player known stations if available.&#13;&#10;He will serve ALL your stations in a sector, unless you assign him to a particular station, starting with the most needed wares it requires. [u]He WILL NEVER serve AI stations, unless assigned to one.[/u]&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[*][b]Distribution Mule[/b]&#13;&#10;This simple Mule is meant to distribute wares between your warehouses, so that every warehouse has at least some of everything. That way you can use a network of warehouses to supply factories in various systems instead of directly supplying your station via multiple production stations.&#13;&#10;[/list]&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[h2]NEED HELP?[/h2]&#13;&#10;First please check out our [url=https://github.com/Misunderstood-Wookiee/Mules-and-Warehouses-Extended/blob/Public/README.md]Documentation and Usage[/url]. &#13;&#10;Requests &amp; BUG REPORTS let us know about them by [b]VISITING[b] [url=https://github.com/Misunderstood-Wookiee/Mules-and-Warehosues-Extended/issues]Our GitHub[/url]&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;[h2]F.A.Q[/h2]&#13;&#10;[table]&#13;&#10;    [tr]&#13;&#10;        [th]Question[/th]&#13;&#10;        [th]Answer[/th]&#13;&#10;    [/tr]&#13;&#10;    [tr]&#13;&#10;        [td]My Travel Mule is stuck looking for trades with certain stations![/td]&#13;&#10;        [td]Try adjust 'Profit Override', this allows you to modify the price the mule sees for station trades.&#13;&#10;0=Sell all wares regardless of trade offer price. &#13;&#10;100= Obey Station Manager's sell offer prices, could be the station the mule is set to has the sell price too high ([i]common issue if the station is a player warehouse with low stock[/i]) use this option to force a trade by setting this slider to 0.[/td]&#13;&#10;    [/tr]&#13;&#10;    [tr]&#13;&#10;        [td]Travel Mule, Max Jump limit is 15 can increase it?[/td]&#13;&#10;        [td]No need!
