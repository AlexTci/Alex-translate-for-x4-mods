			<t id="3">The Nova E, or Nova MK2 among pilots, has been completely redesigned. Not even the cockpit is reminiscent of the outdated version. It was developed to counteract a possible, impending conflict with the Terrans. The ship now has more front weapons, one of which has been fitted with a missile launcher. With a slightly stronger hull and increased speed, this S class fighter is a serious opponent in combat.</t>
