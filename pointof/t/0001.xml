	  <t id="10005">This Ship is an addition to Easy Life, it is more or less cheating. It has a decent Storage area, holds tons of people for the missions, is a very good fighter, almost undestructable, kills even Ks without much of a sweat and has the looks of a very beautiful ship in the game, the OsPrey. I recommend to load it with two Bolts, two Torpedo Launcher and two disruptors. After that, lean back and enjoy your Easy Life in X4.</t>
