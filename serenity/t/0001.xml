	   <t id="10005">This Ship is an addition to Easy Life, it is more or less cheating. It has a huge Storage area, holds tons of people for the missions, is a very good dreadnaught, almost undestructable, kills even Is without much of a sweat and has the looks of a really beautiful ship in the game, the Raptor. Lean back and enjoy your Easy Life in X4. I always loved the Split and their ships.</t>
