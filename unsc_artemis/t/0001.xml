<t id="1">UNSC Artemis-class</t>
<t id="2">The Artemis-class was designed in the mid-stage of the Human-Covenant War, with a single purpose: to completely destroy all Covenant vessels they encounter. Named after the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt, it is often deployed to patrol disputed space regions, using its incredibly advanced sensors to detect and destroy any enemy ships. Such missions are often jokingly referred to as "Hunting Expeditions" by the warriors.</t>
