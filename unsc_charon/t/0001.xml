<t id="1">UNSC Charon-class</t>
<t id="2">The Charon-class features the largest hangar among all UNSC frigates. It is often used to transport ground forces to and from target engagement planets, while also being capable of providing ground fire support. Although the Charon-class has not always been a key player in battles against the Covenant, its role in numerous major battles remains invaluable. The long-standing presence of the Charon-class in human military organizations is a testament to its importance, and it is still favored by veteran naval officers and enlisted personnel to this day.</t>

<t id="11">M870 Bastion 50mm Point-Defense Gun</t>
<t id="12">This point-defense gun is used to counter threats from incoming fighters, landing craft, and plasma torpedoes. Additionally, based on threat analysis of the current target, it can switch between firing 50mm armor-piercing rounds or 50mm proximity-fused fragmentation rounds to achieve maximum effectiveness. It is generally configured as twin or quadruple mounts, paired with a targeting scanner, to function as a turret. Due to being equipped on various warships, the M870 Bastion-type point-defense gun has become a relatively common piece of equipment in the UNSC fleet.</t>
