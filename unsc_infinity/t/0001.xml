<t id="1">UNSC Infinity</t>
<t id="2">The "Infinity" is the flagship of the UNSC (United Nations Space Command) fleet of humanity. As of 2559, the Infinity is the largest and most advanced warship in the UNSC. Commissioned by the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) and secretly constructed in the Oort Cloud, it incorporates technology derived from the Covenant and Forerunners, taking several years to complete. A significant number of Spartan-IV warriors are deployed aboard the "Infinity" for service. The former captain was Andrew Del Rio, who was relieved of command for abandoning Master Chief and the AI Cortana on Requiem. The current captain is Thomas Lasky, who was rescued by Master Chief from a Covenant attack while at the Cobalt Military Academy.</t>
<t id="3">XR2 Borealis Field S81/X-DFR Nuclear Fusion Propulsor</t>
<t id="4">An assembly consisting of a main fusion engine beneath the fusion reactor and two auxiliary engine units. The city-sized engine module took fifteen years to design, construct, and test. The slipspace engine is the Mark X Macedon/Z-PROTOTYPE #78720HDS Revision 2.1, mounted on a remote托架, which is derived from a recovered Forerunner slipspace engine core, capable of exiting slipspace with considerable precision. The engine powers itself by directly absorbing energy from the vacuum bubble, with vacuum energy being independent of the ship's own fusion engine power supply. Due to incompatibility between Forerunner slipspace drives and UNSC conventional power systems and related data feedback, a全新 engine interconnect module based on Covenant engine control limiter modules was installed on the Infinity.</t>

<t id="6">A flagship-class shield generator produced by Misriah Armory</t>
<t id="7">CR-03B Series-8 Magnetic Accelerator Cannon</t>
<t id="8">Capable of launching various artillery shells, cargo packages, and suicide vehicles with dedicated payloads.</t>
<t id="9">M2551 "Ballista" Magnetic Accelerator Cannon Array</t>
<t id="10">The Mark 2511 Ballista-type MAC cannon can fire 15-centimeter projectiles with a kinetic energy of up to 1.1 gigajoules. It features five linearly arranged magnetic coils, each requiring separate charging before firing. It also needs to cool down after each shot, achieved by opening radial vents on the upper part of the barrel. Weapon operation is conducted from an operations station to the left of the MAC cannon.</t>
<t id="11">M85 Sickle Anti-Air Turret</t>
<t id="12">The M85 Sickle is a low-profile, belt-fed, dual-barreled, anti-air/anti-craft weapon. It is designed to be mounted on orbital or suborbital military bases as well as the external hull of warships. Unlike the M71 Sickle, it is not limited to ground defense, as the fully sealed casing of the M85 allows it to be used in a vacuum.</t>
<t id="13">M965 "Bastion" 70mm Caliber Point-Defense Gun</t>
<t id="14">It is the most commonly used shipborne defense system in the UNSC Navy, all operated automatically by computers or AIs, as human reaction speeds are insufficient to fully handle its operation. Its turret consists of dual or quadruple 50mm rapid-fire coilguns and a target scanner. This defense system is used to counter close-range threats, including enemy aircraft and plasma torpedoes. Each turret automatically analyzes the current threat level to switch between sub-caliber armor-piercing rounds and proximity-fused fragmentation rounds, maximizing its operational efficiency.</t>
