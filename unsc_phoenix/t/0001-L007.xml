<t id="13">M800 Bulwark Point-Defense Gun</t>
<t id="14">This point-defense gun is used to counter threats from incoming fighters, landing craft, and plasma torpedoes. Additionally, based on threat analysis of the current target, it can switch between firing 50mm armor-piercing rounds or 50mm proximity-fused fragmentation rounds to achieve maximum effectiveness. It is generally configured as twin or quadruple mounts, paired with a targeting scanner, to function as a turret. Due to being equipped on various warships, the M870 Bastion-type point-defense gun has become a relatively common piece of equipment in the UNSC fleet.</t>
