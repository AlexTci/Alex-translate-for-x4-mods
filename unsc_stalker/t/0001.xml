<t id="1">UNSC Stalker-class</t>
<t id="2">During the critical period of the Great Rebellion, the Stalker-class missile cruiser, as the main warship of the CMA, replaced the older Osa-class and Akita-class. This class of warships not only features a good combination of missiles and turrets but also is equipped with an integrated sensor system, making it the most advanced frigate of its time after being commissioned. However, as larger-class vessels were gradually commissioned, the status and classification of the Stalker-class gradually declined. Even so, this class of warships can still live up to expectations far beyond what other ships of its class can handle.</t>

<t id="11">M870 Point-Defense Gun</t>
<t id="12">This point-defense gun is used to counter threats from incoming fighters, landing craft, and plasma torpedoes. Additionally, based on threat analysis of the current target, it can switch between firing 50mm armor-piercing rounds or 50mm proximity-fused fragmentation rounds to achieve maximum effectiveness. It is generally configured as twin or quadruple mounts, paired with a targeting scanner, to function as a turret. Due to being equipped on various warships, the M870 Bastion-type point-defense gun has become a relatively common piece of equipment in the UNSC fleet.</t>
