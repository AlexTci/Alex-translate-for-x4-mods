<t id="2">The Valiant-class was initially conceived as a compromise design between heavy cruisers and battleships. Before the lead ship was launched and commissioned at Mars Shipyards in 2493, the design of this warship underwent years of reliability studies and redesigns. Although the Valiant-class showed potential in initial tests and evaluations, the high cost and adaptability issues of the new-generation fusion engines seemed to doom it to no further production. Thus, less than two years after entering service, all active Valiant-class vessels were decommissioned by the UNSC Navy, with some being scrapped. Had it not been for the exposure of the shocking revelation that the CMA was infiltrated by rebels in 2497—an event that expanded the UNSC Navy's prestige and responsibilities—the Valiant-class warships would have merely been a footnote in naval history. Almost overnight, the UNSC Navy faced a shortage of vessels for command and coordination purposes, as ships tasked with such missions were soon mired in prolonged counterinsurgency operations. The Valiant-class, with sufficient tonnage and firepower to reinforce battle groups composed of small patrol craft, was entrusted with the role of flagship, leading expeditionary fleets into the depths of the starry sea. It was also equipped with flagship-level bridge facilities for fleet admirals to command from.</t>

<t id="11">M910 Bulwark Point-Defense Gun</t>
<t id="12">It is the most commonly used shipborne defense system in the UNSC Navy, all operated automatically by computers or AIs, as human reaction speeds are insufficient to fully handle its operation. Its turret consists of dual or quadruple 50mm rapid-fire coilguns and a target scanner. This defense system is used to counter close-range threats, including enemy aircraft and plasma torpedoes. Each turret automatically analyzes the current threat level to switch between sub-caliber armor-piercing rounds and proximity-fused fragmentation rounds, maximizing its operational efficiency.</t>
